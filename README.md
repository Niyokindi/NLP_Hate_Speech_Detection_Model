# NLP_Hate_Speech_Detection_Model

With easy access to the internet and its increase in utilization, hate speech online is a major problem in the modern society and its growing at a steady pace​
Cyberbullying is now very common, and it has now become crucial to address this problem and automate the detection of hate content online​
Many big companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google have already deployed Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Models to detect and identify such content; however, they’re not still up to the mark.​
In this case we will shed some light on Twitter’s current methods of detecting hate speech and how ML models can optimize the process with a proposal of building an automated hate speech detection model using Transformer-based NLP models such as BERT and XLNET.

To develop a Machine Learning Model that can hate speech and offensive language on social media platforms, more specifically on Twitter we will require textual data that includes actual content like posts, comments, messages etc.​
The dataset that we used for this study uses twitter data which where the text is classified as hate-speech, offensive language or neither​
The dataset is publicly available and contains ~25k rows of tweets which have been categorized into one of the three classes​
​
Storage: It is essential to use a scalable and secure cloud storage solution for this dataset, while ensuring compliance. Using cloud storage is more beneficial and easier as we would want the dataset to be updated regularly to optimize the model frequently. Options like Amazon S3, Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure offer scalability, reliability, and ease of access.​
​
Format and Size: The dataset, as available, will be stored in CSV format. Each tweet has 280 character limit and has some additional metadata. Since our entire dataset is ~2.5 MB, on average each tweet takes up ~0.1 KB of storage.​
